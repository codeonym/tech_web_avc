let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 30;
let num3 = "30";

// Needed Output
// "30 Is Larger Than 10 And Type string Not The Same Type As number"
// "30 Is Larger Than 10 And Value Is The Same As 30 And Type string Not The Same Type As number"
// "{num3} Value And Type Is Not The Same As {num1} And Type Is Not The Same As {num2}"

// This Assignement Is Not Understandable , So It Was Ignored
